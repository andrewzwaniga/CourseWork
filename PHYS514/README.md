# PHYS514

Note to marker for Problem Set 9: 

Please find a brief description of my solutions and code in the document `PHYS_514_A9.pdf`. 

I have documented my code so you may find it helpful to read the scripts to clarify my process. Furthermore, in `code_output.pdf` I have placed a cursory version of the output that my code can give. It summarizes the most important output. There are additional segments that can be printed to the console showing for example the tensors derived from the Kerr metric; but as these are very large strings of text, I saw no reason to include them in my output file. They can be generated with my code still by uncommenting certain lines, which should be apparent if you look into `analyze_metric.py`.
